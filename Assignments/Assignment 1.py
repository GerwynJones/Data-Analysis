""" 30% and 10% of Republican and Independent voters are, respectively,
behind the change in the law, while 80% of the Democrat voters are in favour. You are visiting the
state, and ask a Police Officer what she thinks of the idea. She says sheâ€™s against the change to
the law. What is the probability that she votes Democrat? """
